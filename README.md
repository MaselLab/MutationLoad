# Mutational Drought Project

## Description

This repository is part of the Mutational Drought project and enables the reproduction of results published in Mawass et al. (2024). The project evaluates the role of mutational drought—defined as the shortage of beneficial mutations in shrinking populations—relative to the previously studied mutational meltdown, which involves the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

The repository includes:

- A forward-time evolutionary simulator written in C, which requires compilation.
- A Mathematica script for analytical analyses.
- Python scripts for analyzing tree sequences from simulations.
- R scripts for generating plots published in the manuscript.

More details on each component are provided below.

## Features

- **C-based forward-time evolutionary simulator** with support for two fitness models and tree sequence recording.
- **Mathematica script** for analytical modeling of mutational drought vs. mutational meltdown under a linkage equilibrium model.
- **Python scripts** for analyzing tree sequences generated by the simulator.
- **R scripts** for reproducing published plots from analytical and simulation results.

## Usage

- The simulator can be compiled using the Makefile or executed via provided Bash scripts in an HPC Slurm environment.
- The Mathematica script requires **Mathematica Desktop** or **Mathematica Online**.
- The Python scripts can be executed in a Bash terminal (see script headers for dependency details).
- The R scripts can be run via Bash or **RStudio** (see script headers for required dependencies).
